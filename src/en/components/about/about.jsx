            <p>
                    I am passionate about technology, I started as a programmer because I was always
                curious about the way websites and games (mainly) were created, so I started 
                studying out of curiosity, and that was the beginning of a complete change in 
                my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I specialize in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery and React.JS. I also have knowledge in PHP,
                MySQL and WordPress with Elementor.
            </p>
        </div>
